âœ“ 60 modules transformed.
public/build/manifest.json              0.26 kB
public/build/assets/app-e55e7947.css   25.51 kB â”‚ gzip:  5.34 kB
public/build/assets/app-10a3e433.js   126.33 kB â”‚ gzip: 43.91 kB
```

Don't forget to comment out the Vite() directives that is not being used in the production;

```html
<head>
{{-- @vite('resources/css/app.css') --}}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('build/assets/app-e55e7947.css') }}">
</head>
<body>
...
{{-- @vite('resources/js/app.js') --}}
<script type="module" src="{{ asset('build/assets/app-10a3e433.js') }}"></script>
